# RLP in Bash

#### ЁЯЪз This is a WIP ЁЯЪз

This code implements the RLP specification in Bash. This uses pure Bash where possible, but in some cases I was forced to use core-utils like `bc` and `sed`.

#### тЪая╕П This was written and tested on Linux so no guarantees that it will work on MacOS тЪая╕П

## Why?

To promote chaos.

## Test

To test the codec, run the following command from this directory:

```bash
chmod +x rlp/tests/run_tests.sh 
./rlp/tests/run_test.sh
```
