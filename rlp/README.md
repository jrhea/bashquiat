# RLP in Bash

This code implements the RLP specification in Bash. This uses pure Bash where possible, but in some cases I am forced to use core-utils.

#### 🚧 This is a WIP 🚧
#### ⚠️ This was written and tested on Linux so no guarantees that it will work on MacOS ⚠️

## Why?

Breaking clients is fun.
### ☠️

## Test

To test the codec, run the following command from this directory:

```bash
chmod +x rlp/tests/run_tests.sh 
./rlp/tests/run_test.sh
```
